Code Information

- The Jupyter Notebook (project.ipynb) was used just to check the Python Code step by step. It has the same code as in the Python File "project.py". To get the interfaces working (Docker, WebApp) we have used the "project.py".

- To create the database we used the SQLite Extension in VS Code. To create and fille the database, we ran the first and third code in the Jupyter Notebook. This code does not need to be run again, as the database is already created and filled with data.


Background

Understanding global population dynamics is crucial for addressing a myriad of social, economic, and environmental challenges. Population size and density are fundamental metrics that can influence a country's resource allocation, urban planning, public health policies, and environmental conservation efforts. With the world population surpassing 8 billion, and projected to reach 9 billion by 2050, it is essential to comprehend how population size correlates with density and growth rates. Such understanding can help policymakers and researchers devise strategies to ensure sustainable development, equitable resource distribution, and effective urban planning.

Problem Objective

Despite the critical importance of understanding population dynamics, there is a gap in the detailed analysis of the relationship between population size, density, and growth rates across different countries. Specifically, it is unclear whether larger populations tend to have higher population densities and how population size impacts growth rates. 

Research Questions

- What is the relationship between population size and population density across different countries in 2022?
- How does the population growth rate relate to the total population size in 2022?
